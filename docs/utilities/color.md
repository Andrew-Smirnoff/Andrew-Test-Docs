# Scan a Written Document
{: .no_toc }

---

Some classes will require you to upload written documents, especially for quizzes. This is an important reason to have an organised desktop!!!
To do this successfully we offer a few options. If you have access to a tablet you can do the assignment on you laptop. If you don't have a tablet never fear!! Adobe Scan is a fantastic app that can scan your document from your smart phone.
The app can be found in the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-scan-digital-pdf-scanner/id1199564834) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.scan.android&hl=en_US&gl=US).
Your last resort, if you do not have access to the app store, you can take a picture of your assignment and send it to your email. For photos, try and make sure that they are readable (for your instructor's sake). Inform your instructor beforehand that you cannot run Adobe Scan and have to resort to this method.
Once the app is downloaded and opened you will be at a page that looks like this:

1. Click on this button to scan a document:

2. Hover your phone over your document and press the circular button at the bottom of this page.

3. Adjust the blue lines to encompass the text on your paper.

4. Click continue. 

You will be sent back to step 2. If you want to add additional pages to your scan repeat steps 2, 3, and 4. Otherwise, continue to step 5.

5. Click on your documents. The number within the circle indicates how many pages you have uploaded.

6. **IMPORTANT** Double check that all the pages you intended to upload are present

7. Click the "Save PDF" button in the top right corner. You will be returned to the main page.

8. Click the share text beside this scan which will be on display at the top of the screen.
9. Click "Share a Copy" which will bring up the options available to you. The method I used was sending a text to myself containing the PDF and then from the messages app on my computer I downloaded the file to the proper files.
