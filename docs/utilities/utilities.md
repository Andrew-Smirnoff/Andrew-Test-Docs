# Utilities
{: .no_toc }

CSS utility classes come in handy when you to want to override default styles to create additional whitespace (margins/padding), correct unexpected shifts in font size or weight, add color, or hide (or show) something at a specific screen size.

## Organization

An organized desktop will be a handy characteristic of your computer when the assignments and quizzes pile up. Set up a file structure on your desktop that is organized and easily accessible for you:

1. Create a file called "bcit" on your desktop.
2. Within that file, create a file named "term-*your term number*" e.g. term-1 for first term students.
3. Within that file create a file for each of your courses e.g. comp-1510.
4. For each of those course files, create an assignments folder inside. 
5. For every assignment, save your work to that folder.

This is a setup that will help you keep all work organized and accessible. This is very important especially when it comes to uploading the correct assignment and quizzes to D2L, more on that to come :)
