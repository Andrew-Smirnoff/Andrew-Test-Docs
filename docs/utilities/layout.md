This page will take you through the steps of uploading a file to D2L.

To upload a file to a submission:

1. Navigate to Assignments in the Activities drop down menu in your class.
   
   Here you will find a list of assignments for your course. These are the sections you will find.
    
    
    ![assignments navigation row](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24902962/114898253-c9d1fe00-9dc6-11eb-88fe-caa5c763a759.png)
    
    
    - Folder: provides a link to the specific assignment and for some instructors, required documents for that assignment.
    
    - Completion Status: indicates whether or not you have submitted the assignment. Values are either "Not Submitted" or "*x* Submission, *n* File(s)".
    
    - Score: the assignment's grade, initially 0.
    
    - Due Date: date when the assignment must be submitted by.

2. Navigate to the link in the Folder section. This is where you will find the Submit Assignment section.

4. Click on the Add a File button.

5. A pop up will appear that will give you options from where you would like to upload your assignment from. *I have not once used anything other than My Computer".

6. Click on My Computer.

7. Click on Upload.

8. Find your file on your device. *This is where the pro tip comes in handy, especially when you're uploading files for quizzes because these uploads are time sensitive*.

9. Once found, select the file and click open. This will return you to step 7. If necessary, repeat the steps to upload multiple files or you can select them all at once by holding Command (Mac) or Control (Windows) and click the necessary files.

10. Once all files are uploaded click Add. This will upload your assignments to your submission but not submit them.

Double check that the correct amount of files have been uploaded.

In this image I have uploaded 1 file. If you have uploaded multiple files the 1 will represent the number of files you have uploaded.

Another way to double check your submission was successful is navigate back to the Assignments page and check the assignment's Completion Status column. The number of files and submissions should have updated.

D2L will also send a submission receipt to your MyBCIT email.
