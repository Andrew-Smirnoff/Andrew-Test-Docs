## Introduction

The Activities section will cover the important categories in a course's Activities tab: Assignments, Quizzes, and Virtual Classroom. These are the most common activities used by instructors. Although they may be simple once familiar, knowing what to do and how to do it will be an important part of your preparation for your program.

This guide will assume that you are inside of a D2L class.

## Organization

An organized desktop will be a handy characteristic of your computer when the assignments and quizzes pile up. Set up a file structure on your desktop that is organized and easily accessible for you:

1. Create a file called "bcit" on your desktop.
2. Within that file, create a file named "term-*your term number*" e.g. term-1 for first term students.
3. Within that file create a file for each of your courses e.g. comp-1510.
4. For each of those course files, create an assignments folder inside. 
5. For every assignment, save your work to that folder.

This is a setup that will help you keep all work organized and accessible. This is very important especially when it comes to uploading the correct assignment and quizzes to D2L, more on that to come :)

## Upload an Assignment

Your instructor will specify the format in which they wish to receive the file and the name of the file.  

### Upload Files on D2L

To upload a file to a submission:
1. Navigate to Assignments in the Activities drop down menu in your class.
   Here you will find a list of assignments for your course. These are the sections you will find.
    ![assignments navigation row](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24902962/114898253-c9d1fe00-9dc6-11eb-88fe-caa5c763a759.png)
    - Folder: provides a link to the specific assignment and for some instructors, required documents for that assignment.
    - Completion Status: indicates whether or not you have submitted the assignment. Values are either "Not Submitted" or "*x* Submission, *n* File(s)".
    - Score: the assignment's grade, initially 0.
    - Due Date: date when the assignment must be submitted by.
2. Navigate to the link in the Folder section. This is where you will find the Submit Assignment section.
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24902962/114899502-ddca2f80-9dc7-11eb-9d78-9d65e140db2b.png)
4. Click on the Add a File button.
5. A pop up will appear that will give you options from where you would like to upload your assignment from. *I have not once used anything other than My Computer".
6. Click on My Computer.
7. Click on Upload.
8. Find your file on your device. *This is where the pro tip comes in handy, especially when you're uploading files for quizzes because these uploads are time sensitive*.
9. Once found, select the file and click open. This will return you to step 7. If necessary, repeat the steps to upload multiple files or you can select them all at once by holding Command (Mac) or Control (Windows) and click the necessary files.
10. Once all files are uploaded click Add. This will upload your assignments to your submission but not submit them.

Double check that the correct amount of files have been uploaded.

![correctly uploaded files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24902962/114902390-a0b36c80-9dca-11eb-893e-1c112d704aa7.png)
In this image I have uploaded 1 file. If you have uploaded multiple files the 1 will represent the number of files you have uploaded.

Another way to double check your submission was successful is navigate back to the Assignments page and check the assignment's Completion Status column. The number of files and submissions should have updated.

D2L will also send a submission receipt to your bcit email. 

### Written Documents

Some classes will require you to upload written documents, especially for quizzes. This is an important reason to have an organised desktop!!!
To do this successfully we offer a few options. If you have access to a tablet you can do the assignment on you laptop. If you don't have a tablet never fear!! Adobe Scan is a fantastic app that can scan your document from your smart phone.
The app can be found in the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-scan-digital-pdf-scanner/id1199564834) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.scan.android&hl=en_US&gl=US).
Your last resort, if you do not have access to the app store, you can take a picture of your assignment and send it to your email. For photos, try and make sure that they are readable (for your instructor's sake). Inform your instructor beforehand that you cannot run Adobe Scan and have to resort to this method.
Once the app is downloaded and opened you will be at a page that looks like this:

﻿<img width="375" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24902962/114906160-a14e0200-9dce-11eb-9b22-c99d377125e7.png">
 
1. Click on this button to scan a document: 
 
﻿<img width="148" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24902962/114906215-aad76a00-9dce-11eb-89cc-fc7551700d3c.png">
 
2. Hover your phone over your document and press the circular button at the bottom of this page.

﻿<img width="375" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24902962/114911293-b7aa8c80-9dd3-11eb-824d-a11fa2cd3d05.png">
 
3. Adjust the blue lines to encompass the text on your paper.

﻿<img width="375" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24902962/114906262-b6c32c00-9dce-11eb-90cb-a7ede3c69eb6.png">
 
4. Click continue. 

You will be sent back to step 2. If you want to add additional pages to your scan repeat steps 2, 3, and 4. Otherwise, continue to step 5.

5. Click on your documents. The number within the circle indicates how many pages you have uploaded.

﻿<img width="375" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24902962/114906291-bd51a380-9dce-11eb-9c40-b8ca2421bcad.png">
 
 6. **IMPORTANT** Double check that all the pages you intended to upload are present
 
﻿<img width="375" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24902962/114906312-c3478480-9dce-11eb-9b60-5b8c2a064934.png">
 
 8. Click the "Save PDF" button in the top right corner. You will be returned to the main page.
 
 ﻿<img width="375" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24902962/114906337-c8a4cf00-9dce-11eb-931c-d7db284810b2.png">
  
10. Click the share text beside this scan which will be on display at the top of the screen.
11. Click "Share a Copy" which will bring up the options available to you. The method I used was sending a text to myself containing the PDF and then from the messages app on my computer I downloaded the file to the proper files.

﻿<img width="375" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24902962/114906366-d0647380-9dce-11eb-8503-83f5400575d7.png">

12. Perform the ### Upload Files on D2L

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: Customization
nav_order: 4
---
```

The parameter values determine the order of the top-level pages, and of child pages with the same parent. You can reuse the same parameter values (e.g., integers starting from 1) for the child pages of different parents.

The parameter values can be numbers (integers, floats) and/or strings. When you omit `nav_order` parameters, they default to the titles of the pages, which are ordered alphabetically. Pages with numerical `nav_order` parameters always come before those with strings or default `nav_order` parameters. If you want to make the page order independent of the page titles, you can set explicit `nav_order` parameters on all pages.

By default, all Capital letters come before all lowercase letters; you can add `nav_sort: case_insensitive` in the configuration file to ignore the case. Enclosing strings in quotation marks is optional.

> *Note for users of previous versions:* `nav_sort: case_insensitive` previously affected the ordering of numerical `nav_order` parameters: e.g., `10` came before `2`. Also, all pages with explicit `nav_order` parameters previously came before all pages with default parameters. Both were potentially confusing, and they have now been eliminated. 

---

## Excluding pages

For specific pages that you do not wish to include in the main navigation, e.g. a 404 page or a landing page, use the `nav_exclude: true` parameter in the YAML front matter for that page.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: 404
nav_exclude: true
---
```

The `nav_exclude` parameter does not affect the [auto-generating list of child pages](#auto-generating-table-of-contents), which you can use to access pages excluded from the main navigation.

Pages with no `title` are automatically excluded from the navigation. 

---

## Pages with children

Sometimes you will want to create a page with many children (a section). First, it is recommended that you keep pages that are related in a directory together... For example, in these docs, we keep all of the written documentation in the `./docs` directory and each of the sections in subdirectories like `./docs/ui-components` and `./docs/utilities`. This gives us an organization like:

```
+-- ..
|-- (Jekyll files)
|
|-- docs
|   |-- ui-components
|   |   |-- index.md  (parent page)
|   |   |-- buttons.md
|   |   |-- code.md
|   |   |-- labels.md
|   |   |-- tables.md
|   |   +-- typography.md
|   |
|   |-- utilities
|   |   |-- index.md      (parent page)
|   |   |-- color.md
|   |   |-- layout.md
|   |   |-- responsive-modifiers.md
|   |   +-- typography.md
|   |
|   |-- (other md files, pages with no children)
|   +-- ..
|
|-- (Jekyll files)
+-- ..
```

On the parent pages, add this YAML front matter parameter:
-  `has_children: true` (tells us that this is a parent page)

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: UI Components
nav_order: 2
has_children: true
---
```

Here we're setting up the UI Components landing page that is available at `/docs/ui-components`, which has children and is ordered second in the main nav.

### Child pages
{: .text-gamma }

On child pages, simply set the `parent:` YAML front matter to whatever the parent's page title is and set a nav order (this number is now scoped within the section).

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: Buttons
parent: UI Components
nav_order: 2
---
```

The Buttons page appears as a child of UI Components and appears second in the UI Components section.

### Auto-generating Table of Contents

By default, all pages with children will automatically append a Table of Contents which lists the child pages after the parent page's content. To disable this auto Table of Contents, set `has_toc: false` in the parent page's YAML front matter.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: UI Components
nav_order: 2
has_children: true
has_toc: false
---
```

### Children with children
{: .text-gamma }

Child pages can also have children (grandchildren). This is achieved by using a similar pattern on the child and grandchild pages.

1. Add the `has_children` attribute to the child
1. Add the `parent` and `grand_parent` attribute to the grandchild

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: Buttons
parent: UI Components
nav_order: 2
has_children: true
---
```

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: Buttons Child Page
parent: Buttons
grand_parent: UI Components
nav_order: 1
---
```

This would create the following navigation structure:

```
+-- ..
|
|-- UI Components
|   |-- ..
|   |
|   |-- Buttons
|   |   |-- Button Child Page
|   |
|   |-- ..
|
+-- ..
```

---

## Auxiliary Links

To add auxiliary links to your site (in the upper right on all pages), add it to the `aux_links` [configuration option]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/configuration.md %}#aux-links) in your site's `_config.yml` file.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```yaml
# Aux links for the upper right navigation
aux_links:
  "Just the Docs on GitHub":
    - "//github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs"
```

---

## In-page navigation with Table of Contents

To generate a Table of Contents on your docs pages, you can use the `{:toc}` method from Kramdown, immediately after an `<ol>` in Markdown. This will automatically generate an ordered list of anchor links to various sections of the page based on headings and heading levels. There may be occasions where you're using a heading and you don't want it to show up in the TOC, so to skip a particular heading use the `{: .no_toc }` CSS class.

#### Example
{: .no_toc }

```markdown
# Navigation Structure
{: .no_toc }

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}
```

This example skips the page name heading (`#`) from the TOC, as well as the heading for the Table of Contents itself (`##`) because it is redundant, followed by the table of contents itself. To get an unordered list, replace  `1. TOC` above by `- TOC`.

### Collapsible Table of Contents

The Table of Contents can be made collapsible using the `<details>` and `<summary>` elements , as in the following example. The attribute `open` (expands the Table of Contents by default) and the styling with `{: .text-delta }` are optional.

```markdown
<details open markdown="block">
  <summary>
    Table of contents
  </summary>
  {: .text-delta }
1. TOC
{:toc}
</details>
```

The result is shown at [the top of this page](#navigation-structure) (`{:toc}` can be used only once on each page).
