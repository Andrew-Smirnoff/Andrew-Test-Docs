### Prerequisites

To use D2L you will need:

- A computer able to run a browser such as Firefox, Opera, or Chrome (we have found that Firefox works better with D2L and Bongo than Chrome)
- A mouse.
- A keyboard.
- A brain.

### Purpose

D2L (Desire2Learn) is a Canadian founded software company that provides learning tools to higher education establishments such as BCIT to enhance online learning. Founded in 1999 D2L bloomed into a online learning titan, making massive acquisitions and raising millionns of dollars. In 2017 D2L went through a massive revamp to make the platform mobile-friendly, this is the version that you see today. 

BCIT uses D2L to provide students with consistent access to class content such as lecture content, assignments, examinations, and a virtual classroom.

### Conclusion

D2L will be confusing because every instructor uses it differently in the terms of which features they use, assignment delivery, group work, course delivery etc. This guide touches on the fundamental use cases that are common across all courses. We wish you all the best in your education and beyond! Cheers, D., A., && N..
